##  4th July 2025 — Housing Price Prediction with Linear Regression

- **Objective:** Predict housing prices using basic linear regression.
- **Dataset:** Real estate dataset featuring variables like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
- **Approach:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Train-test split
  - Model training using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn`
  - Evaluation using RMSE and R² score
- **Outcome:** Built a simple but effective model to predict house prices based on selected features.

11th July 2025 — Iris Dataset Visualization

- **Objective:** Explore and visualize the classic Iris dataset.
- **Dataset:** Contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`)
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Data loading with `pandas`
  - Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
  - Plotted histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots to examine feature distribution and species separation
- **Outcome:** Gained insights into feature relationships and species classification potential through visual analysis.
